# compression-tester
test of RF compression point

As outlined in HP AN-286-2: http://hpmemoryproject.org/an/pdf/an_286-2.pdf

Requires:
Prologix serial adapter, compatible may work.
HP 8901A (B may work?)
2 PCS HP 8656B (Any generator in the HP 855n series should be ok)
Any function generator set to the correct level, and connected to one of the 8656Bs external AM mod input.

This version is a bit extended from the orginal HP-85 code and can now use the same approach to measure both sum and difference on mixers, and measure amplifiers.
